# BlackPill STM32F401CEU6 - ADC Multi Channel Using Two POT

This project demonstrates how to use the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) on the BlackPill STM32F401CEU6 board to read values from two potentiometers (POTs) using multi-channel configuration. The ADC is configured to operate in DMA (Direct Memory Access) Normal Mode to efficiently transfer the converted data to memory without CPU intervention.
